    title: Ski Equipment goes Free
    description: SWISS is the skier’s airline of choice. Why? Skis go free of course! Your equipment flies with no hidden charges, allowing you to spend less time worrying (and paying) for your gear, and more time travelling in comfort to your piste of choice. What’s more, SWISS fly from London to Geneva and Zurich, and in February, even to Sion – the closest hub for Verbier, Zermatt and Saas-Fee.

    description: For those looking for that little bit extra, don’t miss a range of conveniences for little extra cost. At Geneva, skip the security queues with the SWISS priority lane and let them take care of your shuttle to and from the airport. Or, purchase a Swiss Travel Pass, which not only works on public transport across the country, but also gains you free entry in hundreds of museums and offers discounts on mountains trains.
