    title: Ski Equipment goes Free
    description: SWISS is the skier’s airline of choice. Why? Skis go free of course! Your equipment flies with no hidden charges, allowing you to spend less time worrying (and paying) for your gear, and more time travelling in comfort to your piste of choice. What’s more, SWISS fly from London to Geneva and Zurich, and in February, even to Sion – the closest hub for Verbier, Zermatt and Saas-Fee.
