      - p: Verbier is one of those wonderfully snow-sure resorts. High altitude, challenging runs and great lift access maintains Verbier as one off Switzerland’s finest ski playgrounds.
      - p: 100 lifts take you to the tip of 400km-worth of ski runs, with the highest area of Mont Fort offering views that stretch to Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Verbier is particularly famed for expert-level pistes, with challenging terrains set to spike the adrenaline of even the most versed skiers. Heli-skiing and paragliding add to the white-knuckle potential, but beyond the adrenaline-junkie set, more gentle slopes are complemented by unique experiences like husky sledding.

      - p: With its penchant for the finer things, Verbier offers a delicious assortment of fine restaurants and bars to be seen at.
      - p: For dining with a view, no place is as coveted as Chez Dany, a rare treat where the gorgeous views are matched by the delectable dining; don’t miss the Croute au Fromage, followed by a snowmobile taxi ride home. Le Carrefour is a strong fine-dining contender, though the famous rosti proves excellent value. Back in the resort, Le Caveau is a perfect spot for sampling the region’s delicacies – think cheese a-plenty. Slink into classy hotel bars for nighttime cocktails, before the clubs open and Verbier dances long into the night.

      - p: There’s a wealth of spa hotels in the resort, which should come as little surprise; Verbier is, after all, a place of alpine indulgence. So take those ski-wearied muscles to an array of wellness centres set to refresh and reset the body for another day of piste action. Take it one step further and descend the mountain for an excursion to Les Bains de Saillon or Lavey-les-Bains, thermal baths turned wellness retreats where you can sink into the restoring (and most importantly warm) waters of the natural spas.
